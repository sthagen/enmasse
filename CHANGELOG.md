## 0.20.0 (May 23, 2018)
* REST API now served by a new component, api-server, code moved from the old address-controller.  The intention is to have this act as a kubernetes API server, allowing custom resource support for address spaces and addresses. This is experimental at present and not ready for production use[2]. An example ansible inventory file that can be used with the ansible install procedure[3] is provided.
* REST API paths have changed in preparation for custom resources support. An API reference available at [4]. A short summary:

     * The `/apis/enmasse.io/v1` prefix has changed to `/apis/enmasse.io/v1alpha1` which better reflects the state of our APIs in terms of breaking changes.
     * Address spaces are now namespaced, which means that you can create address spaces with the same name in different namespaces. This means the path to address space resources are now `/apis/enmasse.io/v1alpha1/namespaces/[:namespace]/addressspaces`
     * The path `/apis/enmasse.io/v1/addresses` API has 'moved' to /apis/enmasse.io/v1alpha/addressspaces/[:addressspace]/addresses`.
     * A new API under `/apis/enmasse/v1alpha1/namespaces/[:namespace]/addresses` have been introduced to support custom resources for addresses.
* address-controller renamed to address-space-controller
* Kubernetes and OpenShift resources/templates are no longer split into separate folders, but now categorized by component. This means that the different components like authentication service, address space controller, rest api etc. can be managed and upgraded individually if desired which simplifies operations in cases where you want more control.
* Performance improvements to handling large number of addresses in agent
* Removal of per-address resource limits in broker as there was a lower limit than expected on how many addresses and limit settings a broker could handle

* Expose status of addresses in console

## 0.16.0 (January 30, 2018)
* Support for authorization at address level. To enable this, create groups in keycloak on the form 'send_*' and 'recv_*', and have users join a particular group to allow sending or receiving from a particular address (wildcards if you want to allow on all addresses). More detailed docs will follow
* Ability to deploy keycloak-controller standalone in order to automatically manage an  external keycloak instance
* Enable hawtio console for brokers for easier debugging broker state. The console is authenticated against keycloak.

  authentication services. See [authentication design doc](https://github.com/EnMasseProject/enmasse/blob/master/documentation/design/authentication.adoc)
  for details. The authentication services are used by both AMQP, MQTT and console endpoints.
* Secure *all* internal communication using TLS with server + client authentication. This ensures
  that no other component than those trusted by the EnMasse infrastructure can access services
  inside EnMasse.
* REST API for creating/deleting/listing address spaces, see [resource
  definitions](https://github.com/EnMasseProject/enmasse/blob/master/documentation/address-model/resource-definitions.adoc)

35 [issues](https://github.com/EnMasseProject/enmasse/milestone/3?closed=1&page=1) has been resolved
for this release.

## 0.12.0 (August 4, 2017)
* Introduction of the [new address model](documentation/address-model/model.md), which changes how
  addresses are configured in EnMasse. This change comes from design work that has been done by
  the developer team in the past months, which made it apparent that we need to make the model more
  flexible in order to support other topologies than the pure router-based we have today.
* Integration with the OpenShift Service Catalog as an easy way to provision messaging on OpenShift.
* Improved status reporting for addresses. When querying the address controller for an Address,
  the status will now report ready: false if the routers are not yet configured with that address.
* Add support for external load balancers when running on Kubernetes (see templates/install/kubernetes/addons/external-lb.yaml)
* Use Apache Artemis 2.1.0 release as base for the broker
* Bugfixes to address-controller, configserv, console, queue-scheduler and router agent.
