= Standard authentication service

The `standard` authentication service type allows the tenant administrator to manage users and their related permissions through the `MessagingUser` Custom Resource. This is achieved by using a {AuthProductName} instance to store user credentials and access policies. For typical use cases, only one `standard` authentication service needs to be defined.
