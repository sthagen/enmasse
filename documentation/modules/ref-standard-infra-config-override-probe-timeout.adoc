= Overriding the probe timing for standard infrastructure configuration

You can override the default values for probe timing on broker and router resources. You might want to change the default values if, for example, it takes longer than expected for the broker storage to become available, or a server is slow.

The following example shows how to override certain default values of the readiness probe timeout for a broker resource and a liveness probe for a router resource.

          - name: broker <1>
            readinessProbe:

<1> The `name` value must match the target container name. For example, for a broker `podTemplate`, `name` is `broker`, and for a router `podTemplate`, it is `router`.
<2> Specifies the number of times that {KubePlatform} tries when a Pod starts and the probe fails before either the Pod is marked `Unready` for a readiness probe, or restarting the container for a liveness probe. The default value is `3`, and the minimum value is `1`.
<3> Specifies the number of seconds before performing the first probe after the container starts.
