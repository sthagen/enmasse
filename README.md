----

EnMasse provides a self-service messaging platform on Kubernetes and OpenShift with a uniform interface to manage different messaging infrastructure.

#### Features

* **Self-service messaging for applications** - The service admin deploys and manages the messaging infrastructure, while applications can request messaging resources without caring about the messaging infrastructure.

* **Supports a wide variety of messaging patterns** - Choose between JMS-style messaging with strict guarantees, or messaging that supports a larger number of connections and higher throughput.

* **Great protocol support** - Support protocols available in the underlying messaging infrastructure: AMQP 1.0, MQTT, OpenWire, CORE and STOMP.

* **Built-in authentication and authorization** - Use the built-in or plug in your own authentication service for authentication and authorization of messaging clients.

* **Uniform interface to manage messaging infrastructure** - Manage standalone broker instances or a scale-on-demand AMQP message bus using the same cloud-native APIs.

See our [website] for more details about the project.
